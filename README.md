# Fetch Data Analytics MahithaPillodi

This repository is part of the Data Analytics internship at Fetch, WI.

Please refer to main.ipynb for detailed solution/notes and analysis on the data provided. I used Python, SQLite and basic libraries such as Pandas, JSON etc to generate the fetch.db which is the database file which is also present in the notebook.
